						<h4>Novum - A Summary</h4>
						<p>My thesis strives to answer the question <b style="color:black;">“what impact will participatory, group oriented science-fiction experiences have on entertainment media?” </b></p>

						<p>Half of my research question is answered in collected research; plenty of studies have been done in media and entertainment research in established fields, such as television, film, and video games. </p>

						<p>The other half is answered in a primary study, conducted on a small vertical subset of entertainment. Specifically, this is a created augmented-reality experience entitled ‘Novum’ that is intended for two players to cooperatively complete together. This runs parallel to research and created site-specific entertainment in virtual reality.</p>

						<p>From these two viewpoints, I take the role of a futurist in examining what this will mean for the future of alternate reality experiences fitting the science fiction genre.

				<h4>Context</h4>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h4>What is Novum?</h4>
				<p>Science-fiction is a difficult genre to encapsulate into one specific definition. Novum is a Latin word, used by Darko Suvin in his paper “On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre”. He writes that “I should like to approach such a discussion, and this field of discourse [around science-fiction], by postulating a spectrum or spread of literary subject-matter, running from the ideal extreme of exact recreation of the author's empirical environment to exclusive interest in a strange newness, a novum” (373). He dubs this “the literature of cognitive estrangement” (372) in discussing this ‘novum’, or newness. Thus, I have decided to classify science-fiction as any body of work that embodies the idea of 'novum' as a major concept in its identity.</p>

				<p>It is from here that I have decided to name my body of work, and the created augmented-reality experience, Novum, in homage to Suvin’s work in science-fiction and the definition of a genre. As well, it is only fitting to imply there is a newness to my thesis, both in the creation of an augmented-reality cooperative experience, and in the projections for the future, making the name all the more apt. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="row">
				<h4>Why Science Fiction?</h4>
				<p>The genre of science-fiction, aside from being very difficult to define from work to work, is a highly influential genre in two major ways. One, in market, science-fiction is a dominant genre. Looking at the film industry, out of the ten highest grossing films in 2017 science-fiction films claimed six of those spots, using the statistics from Box Office Mojo. In 2018, science-fiction films claimed eight of those spots in the highest grossing films of the year, a thirty three percent increase from the year prior. </p>

				<p>Secondly is the nature of science-fiction writing. It is diverse, with a long literary background that has both a position in socio-political culture, and in futuristic projections. This reflection of the real world, combined with projections of the future, influences our day to day lives as much as it is influenced itself. This dual mirror provides something that is both thoughtful and enjoyable, captivating a large number of people, making it ideal for a study, and a baseline point for entertainment that it holds the majority of.</p>

				<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p>IDEO's design thinking is based off of the principles of human-centered design (abbreviated just as HCD) ("Design Thinking"); as written in Eyal Eshet's paper "Human-Centered Design in Mobile Application Development": Emerging Methods, they summarize the necessity of such design practices in saying that "the HCD approach provides a solid framework of high-level activities for developing interactive systems based on the end-user perspective; Their evolution addresses developments in technology, which becomes more embedded in our lifestyle. Consequently, peoples' relationship with the technology becomes more intimate" (9). Digital development as a whole should follow these principles, not just for application development. Anything that requires a user or participant to interact or react to a digital interface of any sort, it should be tailored in a way that the user does not have to fight with the technology. It should not be taken as a magical fix all when it comes to design, but rather a consideration to creating seamless experiences that are an ease to use, rather than the attempt to complete an activity or task becoming more prevalent than the activity or task itself. </p>

				<div class="work-detail"> <img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0838/5825/t/5/assets/IDEOU_DT_Framework_Horizontal_2000px_V1.jpg?530267673492630901" class="img-responsive" alt="">
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Using a design thinking methodology seemed much more apt than adopting an AGILE Scrum methodology instead, which relies on using short sprint sessions to accomplish a larger task. This method is often used to avoid bottlenecking a project by never letting too long go without check-ins or updates, and often heard of in business workplaces. Higuchi and Nakano point out in their paper "Agile Design: A Combined Model Based on Design Thinking and Agile Methodologies for Digital Games Projects" that SCRUM and Design Thinking do have some similarities between them. However, while Higuchi and Nakano state that "as expected, game developers already use Agile Methodologies in their game development process. It was also observed that the most popular [agile methodology] among developers is the SCRUM"(Higuchi et al. 123) since this has such a heavy reliance on meetings to consolidate work and advance progress, it did not seem like the right methodology to employ for a single person team. This also has some timeline limitations, as due to the scope of the project, iterations can only be made in smaller segments, rather than major overhauls to keep to a coherent piece with a coherent schedule. </p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<p>Taking this in a broader scope, while IDEO is ideal for their push to tell a story at the end of their process, design thinking as a school of thought is applicable for various applications in a context lateral to "game making". As stated in "Making Computer Games and Design Thinking: A Review of Current Software and Strategies", "[d]esign thinking, as the ability to think about – and influence – social systems, can thus be a precursor to learning how to negotiate the complexities of modern life" (Hayes and Games 328). It is namely the influence and thought on social systems that is most applicable in the context of multi-user experiences. Like multi-player, there is an innate social aspect to be explored through the interactions between participants, and between participants and the environment they are interacting with or observing. The five step process is similar to IDEO's, with the steps being empathize <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> define <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> ideate <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> prototype <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> test ("Design Thinking Bootleg"). Empathize process to be the most different, aside from the lack of a "sharing" stage at the end; empathy in design thinking is about leaning about the humans that human centered design products are being geared towards ("Design Thinking Bootleg - Deck"). Using both these processes together will benefit the user, as the product - in this case, the experience - will be catered towards them, and their values.</p>

				<h4>Storytelling in Novum</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>Aliens” by Murray Leinster; the story itself is in the public domain, but remains relevant to the current political climate. With the story being set in space, following the crew of a ship, Novum will pay homage to the story, and act as a precursor to it. With the objective being to test potential crew members for the crew spoken of in “The Aliens”, it does not strive to directly adapt but rather make reference to the impactful story, which will be displayed for participants and visitors to read as well if they wish. As well, it will find a place alongside the study of “Holojam in Wonderland”, and any other related studies if they exist. “Holojam in Wonderland” is about interactive mixed reality theater, and the retelling of the Alice in Wonderland story. Focused on whether or not such media is entertaining, the team put an emphasis on why VR was the best medium, stating “VR still has a strong novelty appeal, which helps attract an audience, but that is not a sufficient reason to use it to tell a story. We sought to demonstrate not just how to use VR for a theatrical experience, but why to do so. What sorts of stories would benefit from being told in virtual reality?” (Gochfeld et al. 365) Following up on this, it is not just fantasy that could benefit from VR storytelling; science-fiction would also suit the medium, with the fantastical elements present in many science-fiction stories. This leads to the conclusion that is it worth exploring other genres in virtual reality, as well as in mixed reality applications. </p>

					</div>

					<div class="col-md-12 row">
						<p>Lending to this notion is the paper “The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives” by Melanie C. Green and Timothy C. Brock, which deals with transportation theory and narratives. Transportation theory is based on the idea of the user being ‘transported’ to the world setting of the story they are observing or interacting with. It deals with the concept of immersion, and how a viewer or player can get lost in a story. Green and Brock list that “[t]he components of transportation include emotional reactions, mental imagery, and a loss of access to real-world information; the resulting transportation may be a mechanism for narrative-based belief change” (Green and Brock 703). While they speak to narrative as a whole, virtual reality, augmented reality, extended reality, and mixed reality, all have the loss of access to real world information as a part of the medium to varying degrees, with virtual reality being the highest connection loss. Through this, we can infer that these four mediums are innately more immersive than traditional forms of storytelling. Green and Brock also state that “people are motivated to at least temporarily accept a fictional world, often for enjoyment purposes” (702). This acceptance is backed up with the fact that in another study, “[p]articipants knew for sure that nothing real was happening, but they still tended to respond as if they were causing harm to the virtual Learner – in spite of the very simple rendering of the character representing the Learner (since presence is not even about realism)” (Slater 432 - 433). Through both of these, it serves a point that as technology becomes more advanced, and becomes more adept at supplying environments that suspend our disbelief, the greater this disconnection from the real world will be. With audiences more readily accepting their environment, storytelling will struggle less with creating that suspension of disbelief and can focus more on providing the user with a compelling experience instead. </p>

						<p>This leads to the story itself. Leinster very blatantly speaks about xenophobia in his book The Aliens. Politically and socially, this feels relevant in two ways. The first, in that science fiction often does still find roots in morals and ideals and often finds a basis in something political. Star Wars’ Imperials are based off of Nazis, and arguably, the First Order can be construed as being based off of Neo-Nazism. Likewise, there are also bio-politics, as Vint mentions in “Introduction: Science Fiction and Biopolitics”, stating that; </p>

						<p>In a biocultural age, understanding the speculative discourses of biopolitics is imperative, and [science fiction] is in a privileged position to help us think through its anxieties and contradictions: the complicated parenting of IVF and other assistive reproductive technologies, including ideas of 'designer' babies, evoked in films such as Splice (Natali Canada/France/US 2009); the fear of pandemics, often conflated with the spectre of bioterrorism to produce narratives about virulent disease and equally treacherous carriers, as in 28 Days Later (Boyle UK 2002); the new economics of patented life forms and privatised food, presented as a nightmare which leads to cannibalism in Pandorum (Alvart Germany/UK 2009). (161 – 162) </p>
						<a name="pNov"></a>
						<p>Biopolitics is not the only political factor that science fiction has the capability and obligation to bring forth. Which brings forth present relevance; regardless of personal views on Donald Trump, his proposed ‘Space Force’ creeps into the territory that The Aliens discusses. Militarizing space has its own complications, and while currently it is not slated for defensive or fighting with extraterrestrials (Durkin), considering problems of racism and discrimination that continue to dig their roots into society, it is not a far leap to see how that would continue to extend to any other species we might meet. Both of these ensure that The Aliens is not only a relevant work to reference, but provides something of an optimistic outlook a well, should one end up reading the story after having heard of it from Novum.</p>

					<h4>Why is this Important?</h4>
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>This project will hold significance in an emerging body of work with studies like “Holojam in Wonderland” (Gochfeld et al.). Not only will it seek to categorize current technologies, and provide speculation on the future of an industry, but will also begin to formulate academic work so that we have a body to reference in the future as an academic community. This also hopes to promote the proper preservation of emerging works and experiences before it becomes a problem such as with video games specifically, where many games have not been properly preserved and are no longer around for study, or where it has fallen to the player community to preserve games in a legally-gray area; this is mentioned by Bachell and Barr in “Video Game Preservation in the UK: Independent Games Developers’ Records Management Practices”, that “[f]an-based initiatives now represent some of the most active groups in preserving gaming heritage, which have attracted the interest of more established institutions, who must consider how the growing wealth of fan expertise and resources can be utilised in future projects, or if they should be used at all” (143). With no established industry standards, and fan preservation being more comprehensive collections of digital games, there is already a dangerous precedent being set for other forms of entertainment media; this danger only grows regarding both the history of alternate reality experiences, specifically in virtual reality, only compounded by many of alternate reality experiences fitting into the ‘digital games’ umbrella as well. </p>
					</div>

					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>Looking at the history of VR specifically, the original virtual experiences were not classified as such because he terminology did not exist to describe them yet. The Link Trainer simulation is considered one of the earliest ‘VR’ experiences (Jeon 38) (Pope 6), and it was a flying simulator that was used by pilots to train and experience what actually flying was supposed to be like, minus the actual aircraft. Pope writes in a paper titled “Introduction to Virtual and Augmented Reality” that “[w]hile other fictional genres have kept the idea alive, The Matrix (1999) is considered to be the driving factor for public interest in VR” (Pope, 6). The history is harder to trace since the terms were not coined until long after conception, such as Tom Caddell in 1990 coining the term augmented reality (Pope 7); creating a body of academic study now that these terms and the language to describe them exists are needed to help promote the study of augmented, virtual, extended, and mixed reality as used in entertainment as a valid area of study, which in turn will promote talk around proper preservation of works. </p>

						<p>Likewise, while digital games are often persevered through ROM dumping and emulation, and movies through ripping and streaming, these multi-‘player’ or multi-participant experiences would not be able to be preserved by the community in the same manner. Since many of these would require specialized setups and are displayed on site locations, there are no files accessible to the public to preserve in lieu of companies and developers taking the initiative to preserve the work. Short of insiders leaking the files, they would be lost forever without proper preservation methods in place for both the hardware and software aspects.</p>
					</div>

					<p>It is because of these reasons that I have made this project's source code avaliable on GitHub, as mentioned in <a href="#pNov">Programming Novum.</a> It is part of an attempt to preserve this as one of many works in this field, for the future. This also is half of fulfilling the "Story" portion of my design method. The other half is the record of this project. </p>
