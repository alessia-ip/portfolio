				<h4>Context</h4>

			<div class="row">
				<h4>What is Novum?</h4>
				<p>Half of my research question is answered in collected research; plenty of studies have been done in media and entertainment research in established fields, such as television, film, and video games. </p>

				<p>The other half is answered in a primary study, conducted on a small vertical subset of entertainment. Specifically, this is a created augmented-reality experience entitled ‘Novum’ that is intended for two players to cooperatively complete together. This runs parallel to research and created site-specific entertainment in virtual reality.</p>

				<p>From these two viewpoints, I take the role of a futurist in examining what this will mean for the future of alternate reality experiences fitting the science fiction genre.</p>

				<h4>Introduction</h4>

				<p>Science-fiction is a difficult genre to encapsulate into one specific definition. Novum is a Latin word, used by Darko Suvin in his paper “On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre”. He writes that “I should like to approach such a discussion, and this field of discourse [around science-fiction], by postulating a spectrum or spread of literary subject-matter, running from the ideal extreme of exact recreation of the author's empirical environment to exclusive interest in a strange newness, a novum” (373). He dubs this “the literature of cognitive estrangement” (372) in discussing this ‘novum’, or newness. Thus, I have decided to classify science-fiction as any body of work that embodies the idea of 'novum' as a major concept in its identity.</p>

				<p>It is from here that I have decided to name my body of work, and the created augmented-reality experience, Novum, in homage to Suvin’s work in science-fiction and the definition of a genre. As well, it is only fitting to imply there is a newness to my thesis, both in the creation of an augmented-reality cooperative experience, and in the projections for the future, making the name all the more apt. </p>

			</div>

				<h4>Why Science Fiction?</h4>
				<p>The genre of science-fiction, aside from being very difficult to define from work to work, is a highly influential genre in two major ways. One, in market, science-fiction is a dominant genre. Looking at the film industry, out of the ten highest grossing films in 2017 science-fiction films claimed six of those spots, using the statistics from Box Office Mojo. In 2018, science-fiction films claimed eight of those spots in the highest grossing films of the year, a thirty three percent increase from the year prior. </p>

				<p>Secondly is the nature of science-fiction writing. It is diverse, with a long literary background that has both a position in socio-political culture, and in futuristic projections. This reflection of the real world, combined with projections of the future, influences our day to day lives as much as it is influenced itself. This dual mirror provides something that is both thoughtful and enjoyable, captivating a large number of people, making it ideal for a study, and a baseline point for entertainment that it holds the majority of.</p>

				<h4>Methodology</h4>
				<p>IDEO's design thinking is based off of the principles of human-centered design (abbreviated just as HCD) ("Design Thinking"); as written in Eyal Eshet's paper "Human-Centered Design in Mobile Application Development": Emerging Methods, they summarize the necessity of such design practices in saying that "the HCD approach provides a solid framework of high-level activities for developing interactive systems based on the end-user perspective; Their evolution addresses developments in technology, which becomes more embedded in our lifestyle. Consequently, peoples' relationship with the technology becomes more intimate" (9). Digital development as a whole should follow these principles, not just for application development. Anything that requires a user or participant to interact or react to a digital interface of any sort, it should be tailored in a way that the user does not have to fight with the technology. It should not be taken as a magical fix all when it comes to design, but rather a consideration to creating seamless experiences that are an ease to use, rather than the attempt to complete an activity or task becoming more prevalent than the activity or task itself. </p>

				<h4>Storytelling in Novum</h4>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-6">
						<p>Aliens” by Murray Leinster; the story itself is in the public domain, but remains relevant to the current political climate. With the story being set in space, following the crew of a ship, Novum will pay homage to the story, and act as a precursor to it. With the objective being to test potential crew members for the crew spoken of in “The Aliens”, it does not strive to directly adapt but rather make reference to the impactful story, which will be displayed for participants and visitors to read as well if they wish. As well, it will find a place alongside the study of “Holojam in Wonderland”, and any other related studies if they exist. “Holojam in Wonderland” is about interactive mixed reality theater, and the retelling of the Alice in Wonderland story. Focused on whether or not such media is entertaining, the team put an emphasis on why VR was the best medium, stating “VR still has a strong novelty appeal, which helps attract an audience, but that is not a sufficient reason to use it to tell a story. We sought to demonstrate not just how to use VR for a theatrical experience, but why to do so. What sorts of stories would benefit from being told in virtual reality?” (Gochfeld et al. 365) Following up on this, it is not just fantasy that could benefit from VR storytelling; science-fiction would also suit the medium, with the fantastical elements present in many science-fiction stories. This leads to the conclusion that is it worth exploring other genres in virtual reality, as well as in mixed reality applications. </p>

						<h4>Context Review</h4>
						<p>Bishop Rollin&rsquo;s article, &lsquo;The Dream of DisneyQuest Is Dead&rsquo;, speaks about the fall of DisneyQuest, and what has become of its remains after both locations were shuttered. Rollin Bishop combines testimonies from individuals that worked as a part of DisneyQuest. They worked on virtual reality long before it was considered affordable, or accessible. The idea of scale was emphasized &ndash; much of what was accomplished was an attempt to reduce the scale of theme park attractions, while retaining the grandeur of the experience. All of the experience behind it was later used as a stepping stone outside of the DisneyQuest experience. Concluding the article, Bishop explains that much of the technology behind DisneyQuest was pieced out, and the attractions were shuttered with it. This holds two relevant points to my thesis; one is that technology advances rapidly, and alternate reality experiences will continue to see rapid progress in more powerful, more affordable technology; when building my work, I have to consider how it is meaningful in regards to the obsolescence of the hardware it runs on. Secondly, it depicts the issue found currently in the video game industry is breaching VR entertainment as well, which is a lack of preservation and proper archival practices, giving a practical example of what happens when said technology becomes obsolete; from this, I have considered how to preserve Novum after it is completed being built, both in terms of the source files, documentation, and playability. Looking into the history of virtual reality, and alternate reality as a whole, DisneyQuest is a midpoint in its development, headed by a major corporation that has the capacity to utilize technologies like this before they are commonly available. Regarding this in the light of where VR started, and where it is today, it provides a timeline for examination that can sustain projections for the future. To ensure the longevity of what I make, and to ensure it is available for future study and reference, it needs to be properly archived. This includes proper documentation, and a public access version of the build to ensure that it can still be compiled and run from the source code. As Novum is intended to be an augmented reality work, the physical artifacts must also be archived in their own way, if not in their original state, then in documentation that allows for them to be recreated in their entirety.</p>

						<p>Agence, by Pietro Gagliano, is about the concept of a three-way authorship and storytelling, specifically in virtual reality and augmented reality. The first author is the traditional author; the director. This is the person who has created the experience and created the framework and initial premise. The second author is the user, and their behavior. As is in many games, currently, the user has their own agency to act upon the game &ndash; in this case, it is in changing the story, and contributing to the authorship. The third author is A.I. &ndash; as technology becomes smarter, and more advanced, the decisions made by them before on their own, and in response to user behaviour, will also have an effect on the final outcome of the story. Pietro Gagliano specifically regards the idea of a user controlled MacGuffin being introduced to the A.I. to show the effects of user agency, and to see if individuals can take the responsibility of it into their own hands. While there is no A.I. in my own work, the study of authorship is a large part of any entertainment media, especially when it comes to interactive or participatory entertainment. This already contains a two-way authorship. In a multi-user experience, there are additional authors; each of the users have their own agency in the scope of the experience, which leads to more open ended experiences as opposed to linearly driven story. Finding a balance between agency and story are another consideration while creating Novum. Research wise, seeing how entertainment becomes less linear, like movies, and more flexible to suit each user will see impact in the future. </p>

						<p>Green, Melanie C., and Timothy C. Brock. &lsquo;The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives.&rsquo; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, vol. 79, no. 5, 2000, pp. 701&ndash;21. Crossref, doi:10.1037//0022-3514.79.5.701. Green and Brock&rsquo;s paper focuses on the concept of transportation theory, and discusses the concept of immersion in narrative. In part, this regards how it affects their actions, and in part it relates to how it affects their perception of the world and the narrative itself. It encourages the viewer to suspend their disbelief for the sake of immersion into the narrative they are choosing to engage with. Three points they argue make up the user&rsquo;s sense of being transported are; emotional reactions, mental imagery, and a loss of access to real-world information. The better a narrative hits these points, the further engaged in the story they are likely to become, disregarding a few situational factors that might engineer disinterest. The amount a user experiences this &lsquo;transportation&rsquo; is also not indicative of quality of work, but merely how much the user is engaged with it, regardless of whether it is considered good or bad, highbrow or lowbrow narrative entertainment. They conducted a number of experiments to test their theory, and concluded that while these points are instrument in ensuring that a work is engaging for the user it is often now strong enough to overcome unideal contexts, such as being under stress, or even in a setting where one is required to engage with the material, rather than approach it willingly. Out of all three points mentioned, alternate reality experiences already engage with the loss of access to real world information via the nature of the medium and their disconnect from reality. This means that narratives driven in alternate reality spaces can choose to engage with the viewer&rsquo;s emotions and the mental imagery supplied, giving it the benefit of being a more immersive form by nature and perhaps enough so to succeed in overcoming other contextual effects. </p>

						<p>Gochfeld, David, et al. &lsquo;Holojam in Wonderland: Immersive Mixed Reality Theater&rsquo;. Leonardo, vol. 51, no. 4, Aug. 2018, pp. 362&ndash;67. Holojam in Wonderland is a an immersive, mixed reality theater performance telling the tale of Alice in Wonderland. Holojam is the development library utilized in the creation of this project, as it is a multi-user virtual reality piece. Despite being in virtual reality, they set the mood right as the participants enter the space via various set pieces that have been crafted. All of the audience become embodied in the virtual space during the theater performance. Speaking to the benefits and limitations of virtual reality, Gochfeld et al. indicate that consumer level hardware is both sufficient and accessible for use. The development kit is as well, and allows for the special tracking of all participants and performers. The largest limitation they describe is the physical space they have available to perform. They also had to consider representation and embodiment to ensure they all had enough of a presence to avoid bumping into one another, while performers and audience members still had to remain distinctly separate in the virtual space. One benefit to a live performance was that errors encountered and technical difficulties were smoothed over by the performers and their improvisation, something that cannot be accomplished in games. Some of the limitations brought up for virtual reality carry over to augmented reality. The space limitation is one of those considerations, as all individuals participating are intended to be in the same space. Augmented reality also has the challenge that the physical space must contribute to the immersion as well. However, some limitations are negated, such as trying to manage spatial tracking of participants, as all participants can see one another. Holojam in Wonderland provides a contrast to the case study I am building &ndash; while it is in VR, Novum is in AR, and while Wonderland is a fantasy piece, Novum can provide the other large genre study in the field of science-fiction. </p>

						<p>Slater, Mel. &lsquo;Immersion and the Illusion of Presence in Virtual Reality&rsquo;. British Journal of Psychology, vol. 109, no. 3, Aug. 2018, pp. 431&ndash;33. Wiley Online Library, doi:10.1111/bjop.12305. Slater&rsquo;s short paper focuses on virtual reality and the presence of the user, and how that interacts with the presence the world gives off. She discusses the technical aspect of the setup, making note of the costly nature of such infrastructure before following up with a look into what points help add to the presence of the user &ndash; something that partners well when looking at transportation theory. Some of the points she considered to be important for immersion are a higher level immersive system, such as a wide field-of-view, high-resolution, stereo, head-tracked head-mounted displays, real-time motion capture, and auditory and haptic feedback (431). These points help to engage senses other than just the visuals of the player &ndash; especially the haptic work. There are newer haptic devices being released specifically for use in virtual reality, which provide contextual feedback for the user upon certain actions happening. These all trick the brain into believing the experience is more &lsquo;real&rsquo; than it is, by engaging the user and transporting them effectively into the work. Slater also argues it effectively removes the brain&rsquo;s unconscious disbelief, like looking over a virtual edge. Even if one knows for a fact and consciously acknowledges it not being real, it still retains the sensation of being such. The tactility is the most interesting portion, and in the context of augmented reality seems the most plausible and most effective to engage with. With the user still able to observe the environment around themselves, making use of objects they can pick up and physically interact with, as opposed to just controllers, will add that additional layer of immersion to the experience. </p>

						<p>Suvin, Darko. &lsquo;On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre&rsquo;. College English, vol. 34, no. 3, 1972, pp. 372&ndash;82. JSTOR, doi:10.2307/375141. Darko Suvin elaborates on the definition of science-fiction, and identifies conventions and markers that are markers when discussing the genre. He makes note that science-fiction is a large concept, and that it cannot easily be summarized due to the diversity of works that fall under the umbrella, and that many of the markers found in science-fiction are not found in all works that are classified as being part of the genre. He coins two terms in relation to science-fiction; cognitive estrangement, and novum, the latter being a Latin term meaning &lsquo;new thing&rsquo;. Both of these relate to &lsquo;newness&rsquo; &ndash; new ways of thinking, new ways of viewing familiar and speculative scenarios. Novum is simply used in reference to new elements introduced to a piece, generally in regards to something that is an unconventional or strange new, as opposed to something expected of the context. Cognitive estrangement is used in Suvin&rsquo;s description of science-fiction, where he defines science-fiction as &ldquo;the literature of cognitive estrangement&rdquo;(372), and is the focal point of his claim in stating that this is the overarching definition of science-fiction. Suvin also explores the notion of science-fiction utilizing this as a method to explore phenomenon, rather than just seek to solve them outright. To study anything, it is imperative to be able to define what exactly you are studying &ndash; in the case of my thesis, Suvin&rsquo;s work is important in helping me to define what &lsquo;science-fiction&rsquo; means in the context of my thesis. The definition I derived from Suvin&rsquo;s paper is that science-fiction entertainment includes &ldquo;any body of work that embodies the idea of 'novum' as a major concept in its identity.&rdquo; From here, it becomes a more manageable task to describe science-fiction in entertainment without it being a nebulous term. It also provides a benchmark that my created case study must achieve to be an acceptable example of science-fiction that is relevant to my research. </p>

						<p>THE VOID - Step Beyond Reality. https://www.thevoid.com/. Accessed 31 Mar. 2018. The VOID is a company currently engaged in the creation of site-specific &ldquo;hyper-reality&rdquo; entertainment. Most of what they have been working on is in large, pre-existing intellectual properties; namely these properties are Star Wars, Wreck it Ralph, and Ghostbusters. Each of these creates a small, original story in the context of the larger intellectual property. The VOID has also created an original work, in the story of Nicodemus: Demon of Evanishment. All of these are short, contained experiences, lasting for about 10 &ndash; 20 minutes, and the participants have free reign in the space around them. With a carefully constructed virtual world, it matches with a constructed physical space, which consists of walls, buttons, and props that can be interacted with. Both their success, and the collaboration with existing properties, it suggests current market direction and where funding will continue to be. Rather than go for feature length play times, they have chosen an experience length that is compact enough that the user does not get tired carrying around equipment, while also is long enough to condense a brief story into; the story, of course, varies by experience, and by player involvement. I informally interviewed employees from the Florida location of The VOID to get further information about the experience. This provided information about user-experience, such as how quickly users picked up the mechanics of the experience, if motion sickness was an issue, whether or not replay-ability was an issue, and other related questions about maintenance and operation. </p>

						<p>Vint, Sherryl. &lsquo;Introduction: Science Fiction and Biopolitics&rsquo;. Science Fiction Film and Television, vol. 4, no. 2, Oct. 2011, pp. 161-. Academic OneFile. Introduction: Science Fiction and Biopolitics is a paper that discusses the political nature of science fiction, specifically in regards to biopolitics. Vint reference specific bodies of science-fiction work to explain the bio-political context of each of them. Certain bio-political references are comparable to the policies of groups like the Nazis, when it came to their eugenics and how that platform was pitched, which she relates to vampire-centric works where humans are the economic source. Some of it is not as negative in light, such as her discussion about Star Trek: The Next Generation, and its bio-political focus on multi-culturalism, management theory, and productivity. This finds root in larger science-fiction works, and in Novum both. In the context of science-fiction as a whole, no work is completely apolitical. Every writer and creator puts their own opinions, thoughts, and beliefs into their work. Some are more apparent than others, such as the Empire in the Star Wars franchise being paralleled to Nazi Germany. Because of this, every work of science-fiction should be mindful about how this is discussed to be as provoking as intended while also not being outright offensive. In the context of Novum, the story chosen as a worldbuilding basis has been selected due to the political context behind it behind exceptionally relevant. Murray Leinster&rsquo;s story The Aliens blatantly talks about xenophobia, and the conscious inclusion of it, in the context of space exploration and extra-terrestrial encounters. In light of Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Space Force&rdquo; and the problems we currently face with xenophobia cropping up in loud displays, it creeps further into a territory close to what is described in The Aliens. </p>

Pietro Gagliano specifically regards the idea of a user controlled MacGuffin being introduced to the A.I. to show the effects of user agency, and to see if individuals can take the responsibility of it into their own hands.</p>
					<p>While there is no A.I. in my own work, the study of authorship is a large part of any entertainment media, especially when it comes to interactive or participatory entertainment. This already contains a two-way authorship. In a multi-user experience, there are additional authors; each of the users have their own agency in the scope of the experience, which leads to more open ended experiences as opposed to linearly driven story. Finding a balance between agency and story are another consideration while creating Novum. Research wise, seeing how entertainment becomes less linear, like movies, and more flexible to suit each user will see impact in the future.</p>

					<p>Green, Melanie C., and Timothy C. Brock. &lsquo;The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives.&rsquo; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, vol. 79, no. 5, 2000, pp. 701&ndash;21. Crossref, doi:10.1037//0022-3514.79.5.701.</p>
					<p>Green and Brock&rsquo;s paper focuses on the concept of transportation theory, and discusses the concept of immersion in narrative. In part, this regards how it affects their actions, and in part it relates to how it affects their perception of the world and the narrative itself. It encourages the viewer to suspend their disbelief for the sake of immersion into the narrative they are choosing to engage with. Three points they argue make up the user&rsquo;s sense of being transported are; emotional reactions, mental imagery, and a loss of access to real-world information. The better a narrative hits these points, the further engaged in the story they are likely to become, disregarding a few situational factors that might engineer disinterest. The amount a user experiences this &lsquo;transportation&rsquo; is also not indicative of quality of work, but merely how much the user is engaged with it, regardless of whether it is considered good or bad, highbrow or lowbrow narrative entertainment. They conducted a number of experiments to test their theory, and concluded that while these points are instrument in ensuring that a work is engaging for the user it is often now strong enough to overcome unideal contexts, such as being under stress, or even in a setting where one is required to engage with the material, rather than approach it willingly.</p>
					<p>Out of all three points mentioned, alternate reality experiences already engage with the loss of access to real world information via the nature of the medium and their disconnect from reality. This means that narratives driven in alternate reality spaces can choose to engage with the viewer&rsquo;s emotions and the mental imagery supplied, giving it the benefit of being a more immersive form by nature and perhaps enough so to succeed in overcoming other contextual effects.</p>

					<p>Gochfeld, David, et al. &lsquo;Holojam in Wonderland: Immersive Mixed Reality Theater&rsquo;. Leonardo, vol. 51, no. 4, Aug. 2018, pp. 362&ndash;67.</p>
					<p>Holojam in Wonderland is a an immersive, mixed reality theater performance telling the tale of Alice in Wonderland. Holojam is the development library utilized in the creation of this project, as it is a multi-user virtual reality piece. Despite being in virtual reality, they set the mood right as the participants enter the space via various set pieces that have been crafted. All of the audience become embodied in the virtual space during the theater performance.</p>
					<p>Speaking to the benefits and limitations of virtual reality, Gochfeld et al. indicate that consumer level hardware is both sufficient and accessible for use. The development kit is as well, and allows for the special tracking of all participants and performers. The largest limitation they describe is the physical space they have available to perform.</p>
					<p>They also had to consider representation and embodiment to ensure they all had enough of a presence to avoid bumping into one another, while performers and audience members still had to remain distinctly separate in the virtual space. <br /> One benefit to a live performance was that errors encountered and technical difficulties were smoothed over by the performers and their improvisation, something that cannot be accomplished in games.</p>
					<p>Some of the limitations brought up for virtual reality carry over to augmented reality. The space limitation is one of those considerations, as all individuals participating are intended to be in the same space. Augmented reality also has the challenge that the physical space must contribute to the immersion as well. However, some limitations are negated, such as trying to manage spatial tracking of participants, as all participants can see one another. Holojam in Wonderland provides a contrast to the case study I am building &ndash; while it is in VR, Novum is in AR, and while Wonderland is a fantasy piece, Novum can provide the other large genre study in the field of science-fiction.</p>

					<p>Slater, Mel. &lsquo;Immersion and the Illusion of Presence in Virtual Reality&rsquo;. British Journal of Psychology, vol. 109, no. 3, Aug. 2018, pp. 431&ndash;33. Wiley Online Library, doi:10.1111/bjop.12305.</p>
					<p>Slater&rsquo;s short paper focuses on virtual reality and the presence of the user, and how that interacts with the presence the world gives off. She discusses the technical aspect of the setup, making note of the costly nature of such infrastructure before following up with a look into what points help add to the presence of the user &ndash; something that partners well when looking at transportation theory. Some of the points she considered to be important for immersion are a higher level immersive system, such as a wide field-of-view, high-resolution, stereo, head-tracked head-mounted displays, real-time motion capture, and auditory and haptic feedback (431).</p>
					<p>These points help to engage senses other than just the visuals of the player &ndash; especially the haptic work. There are newer haptic devices being released specifically for use in virtual reality, which provide contextual feedback for the user upon certain actions happening. These all trick the brain into believing the experience is more &lsquo;real&rsquo; than it is, by engaging the user and transporting them effectively into the work. Slater also argues it effectively removes the brain&rsquo;s unconscious disbelief, like looking over a virtual edge. Even if one knows for a fact and consciously acknowledges it not being real, it still retains the sensation of being such.</p>
					<p>The tactility is the most interesting portion, and in the context of augmented reality seems the most plausible and most effective to engage with. With the user still able to observe the environment around themselves, making use of objects they can pick up and physically interact with, as opposed to just controllers, will add that additional layer of immersion to the experience.</p>

					<p>Suvin, Darko. &lsquo;On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre&rsquo;. <em>College English</em>, vol. 34, no. 3, 1972, pp. 372&ndash;82. <em>JSTOR</em>, doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/375141">10.2307/375141</a>.</p>
					<p>Darko Suvin elaborates on the definition of science-fiction, and identifies conventions and markers that are markers when discussing the genre. He makes note that science-fiction is a large concept, and that it cannot easily be summarized due to the diversity of works that fall under the umbrella, and that many of the markers found in science-fiction are not found in all works that are classified as being part of the genre. He coins two terms in relation to science-fiction; cognitive estrangement, and <em>novum, </em>the latter being a Latin term meaning &lsquo;new thing&rsquo;. Both of these relate to &lsquo;newness&rsquo; &ndash; new ways of thinking, new ways of viewing familiar and speculative scenarios. Novum is simply used in reference to new elements introduced to a piece, generally in regards to something that is an unconventional or strange new, as opposed to something expected of the context. Cognitive estrangement is used in Suvin&rsquo;s description of science-fiction, where he defines science-fiction as &ldquo;the literature of cognitive estrangement&rdquo;(372), and is the focal point of his claim in stating that this is the overarching definition of science-fiction. Suvin also explores the notion of science-fiction utilizing this as a method to explore phenomenon, rather than just seek to solve them outright. &nbsp;</p>
					<p>To study anything, it is imperative to be able to define what exactly you are studying &ndash; in the case of my thesis, Suvin&rsquo;s work is important in helping me to define what &lsquo;science-fiction&rsquo; means in the context of my thesis. The definition I derived from Suvin&rsquo;s paper is that science-fiction entertainment includes &ldquo;any body of work that embodies the idea of 'novum' as a major concept in its identity.&rdquo; From here, it becomes a more manageable task to describe science-fiction in entertainment without it being a nebulous term. It also provides a benchmark that my created case study must achieve to be an acceptable example of science-fiction that is relevant to my research.</p>

					<p>THE VOID - Step Beyond Reality. https://www.thevoid.com/. Accessed 31 Mar. 2018.</p>
					<p>The VOID is a company currently engaged in the creation of site-specific &ldquo;hyper-reality&rdquo; entertainment. Most of what they have been working on is in large, pre-existing intellectual properties; namely these properties are Star Wars, Wreck it Ralph, and Ghostbusters. Each of these creates a small, original story in the context of the larger intellectual property. The VOID has also created an original work, in the story of Nicodemus: Demon of Evanishment. &nbsp;All of these are short, contained experiences, lasting for about 10 &ndash; 20 minutes, and the participants have free reign in the space around them. With a carefully constructed virtual world, it matches with a constructed physical space, which consists of walls, buttons, and props that can be interacted with.</p>
					<p>Both their success, and the collaboration with existing properties, it suggests current market direction and where funding will continue to be. Rather than go for feature length play times, they have chosen an experience length that is compact enough that the user does not get tired carrying around equipment, while also is long enough to condense a brief story into; the story, of course, varies by experience, and by player involvement. <br /> I informally interviewed employees from the Florida location of The VOID to get further information about the experience. This provided information about user-experience, such as how quickly users picked up the mechanics of the experience, if motion sickness was an issue, whether or not replay-ability was an issue, and other related questions about maintenance and operation.</p>

					<p>Vint, Sherryl. &lsquo;Introduction: Science Fiction and Biopolitics&rsquo;. Science Fiction Film and Television, vol. 4, no. 2, Oct. 2011, pp. 161-. Academic OneFile.<br /> Introduction: Science Fiction and Biopolitics is a paper that discusses the political nature of science fiction, specifically in regards to biopolitics. Vint reference specific bodies of science-fiction work to explain the bio-political context of each of them. Certain bio-political references are comparable to the policies of groups like the Nazis, when it came to their eugenics and how that platform was pitched, which she relates to vampire-centric works where humans are the economic source. Some of it is not as negative in light, such as her discussion about Star Trek: The Next Generation, and its bio-political focus on multi-culturalism, management theory, and productivity. <br /> This finds root in larger science-fiction works, and in Novum&nbsp; both. In the context of science-fiction as a whole, no work is completely apolitical. Every writer and creator puts their own opinions, thoughts, and beliefs into their work. Some are more apparent than others, such as the Empire in the Star Wars franchise being paralleled to Nazi Germany. Because of this, every work of science-fiction should be mindful about how this is discussed to be as provoking as intended while also not being outright offensive.<br /> In the context of Novum, the story chosen as a worldbuilding basis has been selected due to the political context behind it behind exceptionally relevant. Murray Leinster&rsquo;s story <em>The Aliens</em> blatantly talks about xenophobia, and the conscious inclusion of it, in the context of space exploration and extra-terrestrial encounters. In light of Trump&rsquo;s proposed &ldquo;Space Force&rdquo; and the problems we currently face with xenophobia cropping up in loud displays, it creeps further into a territory close to what is described in <em>The Aliens. </em>&nbsp;</p>
