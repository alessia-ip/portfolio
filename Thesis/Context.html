						<p>The research behind <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span> came from a combination of theoretical research, and previously created works from this area of research.</p>
						<p>One of the initial questions I had in mind to answer was <b style="color: black;"><i>'what is science fiction'?</b></i> There was no tackling this topic without answering that question first. Thus, it brought me to one piece of writing that was highly impactful on my research.</p>
					</div>

							<h3>Darko Suvin - On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre</h3>
						</a>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							Starting in the realm of theory, that impactful work is Darko Suvin’s paper <a href="https://doi.org/10.2307/375141" target=”_blank”>"On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre"</a>. Despite the broadness of the genre, and the variety of sub-genres it encompasses, Suvin makes an attempt to come up with an all-encompassing definition for science fiction works that was inclusive of all materials coming under the umbrella. He coins two terms in relation to science-fiction; cognitive estrangement, and <i>novum</i>, the latter being a Latin term meaning ‘new thing’. Regarding this newness, he defines science fiction as “the literature of cognitive estrangement”(372). He also takes the time to explore the notion of science-fiction utilizing this as a method to explore phenomenon, rather than just seek to solve them outright.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is important to <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span> firstly in that, to do a study of anything, it’s important to be able to define what it is your work encompasses. As research in this format is based heavily off science-papers, having a categorical or quantitative way to define how you’re studying is a necessity. While developing <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>, I needed to define how I was using the scope of the science fiction genre, and specify how I was approaching the genre as context for the rest of my research. Thus, my definition of science fiction is based off of Suvin’s work. I decided to define science fiction as “any body of work that embodies the idea of 'novum' as a major concept in its identity.” This ensures that works are not excluded from my contextual review of the genre, while also leaving leeway for cross-genre ideas, such as science-fantasy. Secondly, since this concept of defining sci-fi had such an impact on how I approached my thesis, this project is named <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span> in homage to Suvin's work.

						<h3>Science Fiction: Adam Charles Roberts</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							Even after coming up with a personal defintion to convey what I was talking about, science-fiction is still a broad genre that is old enough for there to be conflicting schools of thought about where it starts. Because of this, it was necessary to poke around further in the roots of sci-fi, and to study its history. This lead to my reading of <b><i style="color: black;">Science Fiction</i></b> by Adam Charles Roberts. This book is a literary criticism of the science fiction genre. Exploring the history of sci-fi, he talks about the ‘encounter with difference’, much the same as Suvin uses the term novum. He speaks to the history of science fiction, before bringing up a few social and technological points that require discussion (gender, race and technology) and how each is represented.
						</p>
						<p>
							Science fiction is neither apolitical, or free of bias. Understanding representation in the genre, and advancements through history, can help pave the way for diversity in fiction. It’s specifically important to <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span> in regards to the handling of issues like xenophobia, and also with de-gendering the language used so that it is both respectful and accessible in content for participants in the experience.
						</p>
						<p>This was interesting to consider in the context of the paper <a href="http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A268065530/AONE?u=toro37158&sid=AONE&xid=a53af48e" target=”_blank”>"Introduction: science fiction and biopolitics"</a> by Sherryl Vint. She studied a more narrowed view in sci-fi, looking at the bio-political implications in a variety of works. Some of it was negative, as is to be expected when dealing with heavy handed topics, but some are more light and hopeful, like the obvservations she makes on efficiency and multi-culturalism in Star Trek. </p>
						<p>Both of these writings came to mind when I was selecting and studying the story that became the <a href="Process.html">basis of my played experience.</a> This story is <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24104/24104-h/24104-h.htm" target=”_blank”>The Aliens</a>, by Murray Leinster.</p>

							<h3>Melanie Green and Timothy Brock - The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives</h3>
						</a>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							Progressing to focus on content itself, the logical progression was to look into the transference of content. Since this is rooted in both storytelling and technology, the work recommended to me was <a href="http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/the_role_of_transportation_in_the_persuasiveness_of_public_narratives.pdf" target=”_blank”>"The Role of Transportation in the Persuasiveness of Public Narratives"</a> by Melanie Green and Timothy Brock. They write about a principal called transportation theory.
						</p>
						<p>
							Transportation theory covers the concept of how immersed someone is in the story they’re engaging with. This is based off of three main points of immersion:
						</p>
						<p>
							<ol>
								<li>emotional reactions, </li>
								<li>mental imagery, and</li>
								<li>a loss of access to real-world information.</li>
							</ol>
						</p>
						<p> This happens regardless of work quality, and is based solely on user engagement.
						</p>
						<p>
							VR, AR, and other alternate reality experiences already tick one of the boxes. The nature of the storytelling medium has a loss of real world access for the user, more so than related mediums (like video games) provide. Like other visual mediums, it also helps augment a person’s mental imagery. That leaves the emotional reactions – the maker behind the project can focus on this aspect, since the other two are already covered by the medium choice; this was what my focus had to be on in creating <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>, which benefits from the immersion provided by AR as a medium.

							<h3>Mel Slater - Immersion and the Illusion of Presence in Virtual Reality</h3>
						</a>


					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							While Melanie and Timothy speak about storytelling immersion, Mel Slater speaks about immersion and player presence specifically in VR in the paper -<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12305" target=”_blank”> "Immersion and the Illusion of Presence in Virtual Reality"</a>. Some of the points she considered to be important for immersion are a higher level immersive system, such as a wide field-of-view, high-resolution, stereo, head-tracked head-mounted displays, real-time motion capture, and auditory and haptic feedback
						</p>
						<p>
							As AR and VR are closely related fields, and many of these points are applicable to both (and therefore, applicable to <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>). High resolution screens, as well as auditory, haptic, and other tactile feedback are important in a medium that is embedding digital artifacts into a physical space, and out of these, I could control both the physical display of the project, and the tactile interface needed to participate in the virtual environment. This was to be comprised of the image targets each participant could handle to change the state of the virtual environment.

							This participant participation in shaping narrative is discussed by Pietro Gagliano in his video <a href="https://vimeo.com/272422803/943bc417bf" target=”_blank”>"Agence"</a>. It is a discussion of changing authorship in stories as technology advances. He discusses the concept of three way authorship, between the original author, the participant, and an AI.
						</p>
						<p>
							While there is no A.I. in <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>, it is important to consider the dual authorship that comes in any format of interactive entertainment. . Research wise, seeing how entertainment becomes less linear, like movies, and more flexible to suit each user will see impact in the future.

					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							With a more solid theoretical basis to work from, studying how established works handled their own narratives was a step of inspiration. The first commercial experience that I wanted to write about it the work from <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12305" target=”_blank”>THE VOID</a>. This company creates what they call ‘hyper-reality’ experiences. They make full body, immersive VR experiences, mainly set in established intellectual properties, such as Star Wars. They also have one experience that is based on their own original property, called “Nicodemus: Demon of Evanishment”.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, this implies there is a sustainable market for this type of experience, and a shift from games as a product to games as a service (and I considered how this would affect user perception of presentation). Secondly, studying how they’ve structured their experiences informed how I could build mine. They keep to short experiences that guide the viewer without making it feel like they’re railroaded in, and make good use of a tactile environment, even in a VR space.

							<p>I conducted a few informal interviews with employees at one of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjop.12305" target=”_blank”>THE VOID</a> locations about the experiences they offered. They will remain nameless for the sake of privacy.</p>
							<p>Some of the common answers that came up consistently were that they found traversing the worldspace was easily taught, even to those with very little literacy in the digital space.</p>
							<p>It is not as accessible an experience, and they find that kids at times have more trouble as the equipment is quite heavy.</p>
							<p>They do have measures in place for those who do end up having trouble, which they go over. These include raising one's hand to get the attention of an employee, or putting a hand on the wall as a steadying anchor (since all the walls have a real world counterpart).</p>
							<p>Out of all the tasks involved, the most time consuming one is the upkeep and maintenance of all the equipment - something that is paralleled historically at DisneyQuest.</p>

						<p>
							The second piece I studied for narrative and construction was <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3203091" target=”_blank”>"Holojam in Wonderland"</a>, which is an immersive, mixed reality theater performance telling the tale of Alice in Wonderland. They have the audience become participants in the virtual performance space, and have real actors perform inside of the virtual world as well.
						</p>
						<p>
							Like <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>, Holojam is more a story than a full on game for the audience. And while they are in VR, my work is in AR, which makes the two a good comparative piece. As well, while Novum inhabits the science-fiction space, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3203091" target=”_blank”>"Holojam in Wonderland"</a> inhabits the fantasy genre.

							Lastly I did research on a new experience called <a href="https://www.darkslopestudios.com/" target=”_blank”>Scary Girl</a>. is a free-roam multi-user experience developed by Dark Slope. They’ve focused on building a site-specific virtual reality experience, and they also plan to make future AR and VR titles.
						</p>
						<p>
							As I had a hand in working on this project in collaboration with the Dark Slope team, it gave me a great deal of insight into participant pathing and how to guide someone through the space. It also was informative, as Dark Slope’s work inhabits a similar space to <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>, and being able to study how they integrated the space, and tactility of the game fed into my own research. Being a part of this project gave me a good comparison of how virtual reality and augmented reality are differing in this space, and the span of technical difference and accessibility in creation.

						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8">
						<p>
							These are all relatively new works, but VR and related mediums are much older, to the point where the practice extends further back than the language used to describe it - the <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/article/572110" target="_blank">Link Trainer is considered to be the earliest example of virtual reality.</a> Another not-so-old example is the Disney VR space, DisneyQuest, which is no longer operational. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2018/10/18/17888722/disneyquest-disney-vr-closed" target=”_blank”>"The Dream of DisneyQuest Is Dead"</a>, by Rollin Bishop, is an article talking about the now abandoned DisneyQuest experience. Rollin speaks about what DisneyQuest was, and what became of it after its downfall.
						</p>
						<p>
							The importance comes not from the article, but from the artifact of DisneyQuest. It was pioneering a lot of technology for the time, and the history of virtual reality experiences gives a good timeline for progression. This can provide a basis for examining how alternate reality experiences may look in the future. Secondly, it poses as a warning as well. With how quickly technology becomes obsolete, and the poor practices surrounding preservation in games, it’s clear that creating a repository of work could prove to be problematic. With DisneyQuest itself having sold off or abandoned much of its tech, as well as the lack of preservation of the experiences themselves, there is little record of it to keep it for knowledge for the future. It will be an important consideration to make sure that proper preservation techniques are put into place, and to think about what artifacts are best preserved from <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>.
