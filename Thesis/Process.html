											<h3>The Aliens: By Murray Leinster</h3>
										</a>

										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-7">
												<h4> Summary</h4>
												<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24104/24104-h/24104-h.htm" target="_blank">The Aliens</a> is a novel by Murray Leinster – this was the pseudonym that author <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/leinster_murray" target="_blank">William Fitzgerald Jenkins</a> wrote most of his science-fiction work under. The Aliens is about a crew of humans, specifically the protagonist Jon Baird, and an encounter with aliens. It can be considered a hard science fiction read – it does consider science as a factor in play, and still tends to lean to explaining plausible, if impossible at the time of writing, information about the rules of the world. This includes information like what the human crew’s ship’s physical capabilities are, and a slightly more vague description of the alien one encountered, as well as biological differences. </p>

												<h4>Analysis</h4>
												<p>Some of the themes and tropes that I wanted to explore further when creating <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span> were:</p>
												<ul>
													<li><i><b>Personal bias</b></i>: "Baird shook his head, to himself. The Niccola’s orders were to make contact without discovery, if such a thing were possible. The ideal would be a Plumie ship or the Plumie civilization itself, located and subject to complete and overwhelming envelopment by human ships—before the Plumies knew they’d been discovered. And this would be the human ideal because humans have always had to consider that a stranger might be hostile, until he’d proven otherwise." (13)</li>
													<li><i><b>Xenophobia</b></i>: "His choice had been deliberate, because he was a xenophobe. ... Because if the Plumies were hostile, a well-adjusted, normal man would never think as much like them as a Taine. He was capable of the kind of thinking Plumies might practice, if they were xenophobes themselves." (13)</li>
													<li><i><b>Non-conformity</b></i>: "'I’m trying,' said Baird bitterly, 'according to orders!' But he disagreed with those orders. It was official theory that arithmetic values, repeated in proper order, would be the way to open conversation. The assumption was that any rational creature would grasp the idea that orderly signals were rational attempts to open communication.But it had occurred to Baird that a Plumie might not see this point." (16)</li>
													<li><i><b>Communication</b></i>: "The Plumie gazed about with an air of lively curiosity. Then he drew out a flat pad with a white surface and sketched swiftly. He offered it to the Niccola’s skipper." (26)</li>
												</ul>

										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-12">
												<h4>Adaptation</h4>
											</div>
											<div class="col-md-4">
												<p>Despite not being a well-known work, The Aliens seemed like the perfect work for adaptation for a few reasons:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>Many of these topics are still currently relevant today.</li>
													<li>It had enough world-building to provide a good frame of reference, without a rigid timeline.</li>
													<li>The classic science-fiction tropes of aliens and space would fit the criteria of my definition, and view that way to a viewer as well, in familiarity. </li>
												</ol>
											</div>

											<div class="col-md-8">
												<p>Keeping these topics, and the main themes of the story in mind, I adapted Murray’s work for my own story. The first part comes through in the told story: both participants are applicants to join the Niccola’s mission in space (the Niccola being the ship from the novel). This serves as a prequel to the original story. The interactive experience is a very brief test for both participants, and they are both allowed the option to interact with additional objects to gain additional story cues from them. </p>
												<p>The rest would be explored in the method of storytelling itself. Part of this falls back on the trope of an unreliable narrator. In the context of the participant’s test, the answers that may seem more intuitive or correct are generally not, and are there to make the participant uncomfortable and doubt both themselves and their test partner. </p>

								<h2> Experience Flow </h1>
									<div class="row">
										<h3>Version One</h3>
										<div class="col-md-8 work detail" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">

										<div class="col-md-1"></div>
										<div class="col-md-3">
											<br>
											<p>Version one of my experience flow was created to try and envision the interaction between participants. This was changed drastically between this version and the final, as the participants were much more involved with one another than with the experience itself at this point in time. </p>
										</div>
									</div>
									<div class="row">
										<h3>Version Two</h3>

										<div class="col-md-8 work detail" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">

										<div class="col-md-1"></div>
										<div class="col-md-3">
											<br>
											<p>Version two of <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>'s experience flow focused more on the technical side of <span style='font-family:"Bitwise";'>Novum</span>. This include how the devices would interact with one another, and what setup was required for this to work. At this point in time, I was still utilizing Unity's built in server functionality and relying on a third server host (a Mac computer that would host the LAN) to manage the experience.</p>
											<p>While this setup would work in theory, poor documentation on the Unity server manager made it difficult to implement in a way that was both functional and efficient. </p>

										<h3>Prototyping</h3>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-md-6" style="padding-left: 0px;">
												<h4>Version One</h4>
												<p>Version one of physical fabrications was kept exceptionally simple for testing purposes. Paper only targets were used by themselves as easy to replace image targets.</p>

												<h4>Version Two</h4>
												<p>Version two experimented with the form of objects. Using balsa wood as an inexpensive prototyping material, different mockups were assembles to test what felt best for the participant to hold.</p>
												<p>Cubes were one of the least pleasing, since they had no 'correct' direction to be oriented. Pyramids, however, worked well due to the fact they could be marked to have a right side up, which helped guide participant interaction.</p>
												<p>Using a cnc machine helped to speed up this proccess considerably.</p>

										<h3>Other Setup</h3>
										<div class="col-md-8" style="padding-left: 0px;">
											<p>Part of what was necessary for this setup was some way to mount both phones. This was so that the participants can focus on handling the physical objects, and not handling the screen itself.</p>
											<p>The solution to this was using gooseneck phone mounts - this gave enough flexibility to position them comfortably at each participant's work station, while also enough sability to keep them in place for the duration of the experience.</p>
